We play this game for too long, each of us trying to prolong our desires, to push patience aside, to throw more and more kindling on the fire. You are riding the edge of pleasure and pain. You are being devoured alive, the beast, a ferocious creature, slowly driving you over the edge. You close your eyes and roll them into the back of your head. You feel the dopamine and serotonin being released into your brain. You are floating in the clouds, riding the hot waves of air, suddenly ejected into a pleasureful haven, awash in ecstasy. Your eyes flash open, a myriad of visions flash through your thoughts, and then you close them again, as the night sky opens up, and you let everything go… but you disappear into it, and, to me, this is the most pleasurable experience, to watch you let go, and to watch you awash in the most pleasurable of delights.',
